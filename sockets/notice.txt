If you use(include) both the asynchronous and synchronous socket i/o header files then you must do the following:

“When VC++ compiles all the files down it puts them all in the one folder and basically just overwrites the first output file with the second.
To fix this, you can set it to use the folder name as part of the file output. 
These instructions were current as of Visual Studio 2013 (Update 3)”


Right click your VC++ project, click “Properties”
Expand “Configuration Properties”
Expand “C/C++”
Select “Output Files”
Select “Object File Name” and change it from “$(IntDir)” to "$(IntDir)$(AssemblyName)\%(RelativeDir)\” or "$(IntDir)$(AssemblyName)\$(Configuration)\%(RelativeDir)\" (preferred)
That way, the folder path is taken into account and not just the file name.
